# Resonite-YT-DLP-Updater
A script to update yt-dlp.exe in your resonite install dir. 

Original script by Knackrack615 on NeosVR for NeosVR.

Ported by me.

ik with resonite being up to date these scripts are not needed but they are here in case of any big updates with yt-dlp while waiting for resonite update.
The original script was only a .vbs file

I have ported the original script and also converted it to Python, javascript
